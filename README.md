# Modeling Practice for the Card Game WAR

In a series of posts on my blog, I do "modeling practice" by taking common board and card games and modeling them as C# command-line programs.

This is the latest effort: a model of the [card game WAR](https://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/).

You can read more about this project at my blog [Exception Not Found](https://exceptionnotfound.net/modeling-the-card-game-war-in-c-part-1-background-and-rules/#disqus_thread).
